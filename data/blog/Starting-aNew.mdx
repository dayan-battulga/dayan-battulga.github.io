# My Personal Website

I wanted to make a website that can showcase my skills and projects, but also show my personality.
This is a long time coming, especially because everybody has a personal website, and I have spent around 2 weeks just planning what
libraries and frameworks to use.

Hopefully, you like my UI design and the aesthetic of this website because that was my primary focus.
I think later down the line I want to incorporate a live-stream feature where you can see me doing some work.

Thanks for reading and spend some time here checking out random stuff!
:D
