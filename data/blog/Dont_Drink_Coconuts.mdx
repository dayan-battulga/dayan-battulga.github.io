# Green Good, Brown Bad

This is just to test the functionality of my blog post page and section on the main page.

Thanks for clicking on this blog post! I didn't know you were interested in coconuts, but here is
a fun fact:

**_Did you know if you drink ripe coconut (brown coconuts) water, you lose a lot of fluid because its a laxative._**

**_So if you are stranded on an island, you should only drink from the unripe green ones because they don't make you lose fluids and keep you hydrated._**

Remember this for the next time you are stranded on an island ;)
